      <p>I am a Junior Software Engineer with a background in Manufacturing Engineering. For eight years, I worked in the Aerospace industry, where I developed a deep understanding of precision, problem-solving, and innovation. However, I reached a point where I felt I was coasting, and that wasn't fulfilling. I thrive on challenges and constant learning, so I decided it was time for a change.</p>
      <p>Fueled by my interest in technology and a passion for understanding how things work, I took a leap into software engineering by completing the General Assembly: Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. This intensive program expanded my technical skill set and reinforced my love for building solutions and solving complex problems.</p>
      <p>Now, I'm excited to apply my engineering mindset and newly honed software skills in a professional setting. I'm eager to contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with innovative teams, and continue growing in a field where learning never stops.</p>
